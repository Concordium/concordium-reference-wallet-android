    Whether you choose an individual baking pool or the L-pool, rewards are paid out at what is called the pay day. Rewards are distributed to everyone in the pool proportional to their stake, and a commission is paid to the baker by all delegators.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you make updates to your delegation at a later point, most of these will also take effect from the next pay day.
