    <p>
    If you decrease your stake, the change will take effect after a cool-down period.
    </p>
    <p>
    While in this cool-down period, the stake is locked and cannot be changed, and you will not be able to stop your delegation.
    </p>
    <p>
    Your delegation continues earning rewards during the cool-down period. While in the cool-down period you can update other delegation settings, but not the amount.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you made any other changes to your delegation while also decreasing your delegation amount, the other changes will take effect from the next pay day as described on the previous page.
