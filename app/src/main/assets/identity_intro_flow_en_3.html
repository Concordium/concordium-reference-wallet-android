            You can choose which identity provider you want to use yourself.

            Once one of the identity providers has verified your real life identity, they will return the Concordium Identity to your wallet.

            To become verified, you will have to supply one or more photos of an official ID document, for example a passport or a drivers license. You will also need to supply a photo of yourself.
