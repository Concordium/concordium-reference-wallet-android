    <p>
    If you decide to stop your delegation, there is a longer cool-down period.
    </p>
    <p>
    While in the cool-down period your delegation continues to earn rewards.
    </p>
    <p>
    At the end of the cool-down period, the delegated amount is unlocked on your public balance, and the funds will be at disposal again.
