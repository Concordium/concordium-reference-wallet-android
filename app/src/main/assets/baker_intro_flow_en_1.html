    A validator is a node that participates in the network by producing (creating) new blocks that are
    added to the chain. Each validator has a set of cryptographic keys called validator keys that the node
    needs to produce blocks. You generate the validator keys in the Mobile Wallet when you add a validator
    account. Once the validator node has been restarted with the validator keys, it will start producing two
    epochs after the transaction has been approved.
