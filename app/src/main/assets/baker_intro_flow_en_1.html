    A baker is a node that participates in the network by baking (creating) new blocks that are
    added to the chain. Each baker has a set of cryptographic keys called baker keys that the node
    needs to bake blocks. You generate the baker keys in the Mobile Wallet when you add a baker
    account. Once the baker node has been restarted with the baker keys, it will start baking two
    epochs after the transaction has been approved.
