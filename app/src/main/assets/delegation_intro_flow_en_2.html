    <p>
        There are two types of pools for delegation:
        <ul>
            <li>Baker pools</li>
            <li>The lock-up pool, also known as the L-pool</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        A baker pool is managed by an individual baker running a node, while the L-pool is a common pool that lives on the entire blockchain.
    </p>
    <p>
        Both earn rewards, though at different rates.
