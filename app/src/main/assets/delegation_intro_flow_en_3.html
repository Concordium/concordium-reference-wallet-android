<p>
    A baker pool is managed by an individual baker.
</p>
<p>
    Running a pool allows a baker to attract more stake and thus increase chances of being selected
    to bake a block.
</p>
<p>
    Bakers also earn a commission from the delegators upon baking a block.
</p>
<p>
    Delegating to a baker pool is usually more profitable than passive delegation, but there is also
    a risk of losing out on rewards if the baker is not running properly. It is therefore a good
    idea to keep an eye on the baker’s performance.
