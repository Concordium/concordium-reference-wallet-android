    <p>
        When you make a delegation to either type of pool, your delegation amount will be locked on your account.
    </p>

    <p>
        This means that you cannot use the amount for anything while it is still locked in the delegation.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you either decrease your delegation amount or stop the delegation altogether, the amount will still be locked for a cool-down period. While in the cool-down period, that full delegation amount will keep earning rewards.
    </p>

    <p>
        As all transactions cost a fee, it is important to take into consideration, that you will need some unlocked funds on your public balance to pay the fee for unlocking your delegation amount again.
