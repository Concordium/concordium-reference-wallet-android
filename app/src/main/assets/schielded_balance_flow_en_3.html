    A shielding transaction is a transfer that moves CCD from your balance to your shielded balance
    in your account.
</p>
<p>
    You decide how much you want to move to the shielded balance. Just make sure the remaining
    balance is sufficient
    to cover the transaction fees. The amount in this transaction will be visible on the blockchain.
