        Once your initial account and identity is ready, you will be reminded to create a backup of your private keys.
    </p>
    <p>
        The backup should be kept very safe, as it, together with the password, <b>is the only way to restore access
            to your accounts</b>, should you lose or have to re-install your wallet app.
    </p>
    <p>
        You risk losing your CCD if you don't make a backup and keep it somewhere secure.
