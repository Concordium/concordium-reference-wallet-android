<p>
    If you no longer wish to validate on an account, you can stop validation. There is a cool-down period,
    during which the staked amount for the validator will continue to validate and earn rewards. After the
    cool-down, the full stake amount will be unlocked on your public balance.
</p>
<p>
    If your pool has any delegators, they will be automatically moved to passive delegation, if they
    donâ€™t decide to do something else.
</p>
<p>
    If you deregister the validator, remember that this does not shut down your node. You must shut down
    the node in a separate action if you no longer wish to run a node on the Concordium blockchain.
