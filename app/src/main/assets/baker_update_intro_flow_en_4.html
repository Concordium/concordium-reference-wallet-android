        There is a cool-down period if you choose to close a pool. During this time, all delegators continue in the pool, and the pool continues to earn rewards if it validates.
    </p>
    <p>
        After the cool-down, the delegators are removed and the pool will be closed. The validator will keep validating with your own stake afterwards.

        Changes to the metadata URL take effect from the next pay unless the transaction is made too close to the pay day. In that case, it will take effect from the next pay day over.
