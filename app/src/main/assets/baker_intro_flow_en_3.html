        You have the option when adding a validator to open a staking pool or not. A staking pool allows others who want to earn rewards to do so without the need to run a node or become a validator themselves. To do this they delegate an amount to your staking pool which then increases your total stake and your chances of winning the lottery to produce a block. At each pay day the rewards will be distributed to you and your delegators. You can also choose not to open a pool, in which case only your own stake applies toward the lottery. You can always open or close a pool later.
