    You have the option when adding a baker to open a baker pool or not. A baker pool allows others
    who want to earn rewards to do so without the need to run a node or become a baker themselves.
    To do this they delegate an amount to your baker pool which then increases your total stake and
    your chances of winning the lottery to bake a block. At each pay day the rewards will be
    distributed to you and your delegators. You can also choose not to open a pool, in which case
    only your own stake applies toward the lottery. You can always open or close a pool later.
