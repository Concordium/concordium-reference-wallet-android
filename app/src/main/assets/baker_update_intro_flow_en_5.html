        If you believe your baker keys have been compromised or lost, you can generate and submit a new set of keys. It is important to remember to restart your node with the new set of keys after registering them on the chain. As the update takes effect on chain from the next pay day, it is preferable to restart the node with the new keys as close to the next pay day as possible to prevent the baker from having down time.</p>
