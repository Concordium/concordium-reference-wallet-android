    <p>
    For CCD holders who do not want to regularly check the performance of their pool, but just want a stable way of earning interest, the L-pool (Lock-up pool) offers a low-risk, low-reward alternative.
    </p>

    <p>
    This pool is not associated with a specific baker, so there is no risk of poor baker health.
    </p>

    <p>
    The trade off when choosing the stable L-pool is that the return of your stake will be less than what you might see with a baker pool.
