<p>
    For CCD holders who do not want to regularly check the performance of a chosen pool, but just
    want a stable way of earning rewards, passive delegation offers a low-risk, low-reward
    alternative.
</p>
<p>
    This staking strategy is not associated with a specific baker, so there is no risk of poor baker
    health.
</p>
<p>
    The trade-off when choosing passive delegation is that the return on your stake will be less
    than what you may receive, when delegating to a specific baker pool.
