    Other participants in the network will be able to see the amount of CCD you move between your
    public and
    shielded balances. However, they can't see the amount stored on the shielded balance or the
    amounts in any
    shielded transfers going in or out of the account.
</p>
<p>
    The shielded transfer transactions are visible on chain including the optional memo.

<p>
    <b>
        Only the amount of CCD in the shielded transfer will be private.
