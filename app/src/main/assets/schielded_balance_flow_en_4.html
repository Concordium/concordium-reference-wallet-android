    A shielded transfer is a transfer from the shielded balance of one account to a shielded balance
    of another
    account.
</p>
<p>
    The amount that is transferred is only visible to the sender and the receiver. The transaction
    fee is higher
    than a regular transfer and is paid by the sender account.

    You will be able to see a diagram of this on the next slide.
